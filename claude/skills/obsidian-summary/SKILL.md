name: obsidian-summary
description: Save a structured summary of the current session to the Obsidian vault. Use when asked to save, log, or summarise to Obsidian, when writing a doc or reference note, when capturing a decision or ADR, or when context is getting long. Produces Obsidian-flavoured markdown with wikilinks, callouts, frontmatter, and Dataview-compatible properties.

## Purpose

Produce a well-structured Obsidian note from the current session and write it to the vault. The output must be useful out of context — readable weeks later by someone (including you) who wasn't in the session.

All output uses Obsidian-flavoured markdown: YAML frontmatter with Dataview-compatible properties, `[[wikilinks]]` for internal vault links, `> [!type]` callouts for highlighted information, and Mermaid diagrams where structure warrants it.

---

## Step 1 — Infer the note type

Before deriving paths or generating content, determine what kind of note this session calls for. Show the inferred type and confirm before proceeding.

| Type | When to use | Default location |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| `session` | General work summary, branch progress, task completion | `50-notes/AI Sessions/<project>/<label>/` |
| `document` | Standalone reference meant to be read on its own (how-to, explainer, overview) | `50-notes/Docs/<project>/` |
| `decision` | A specific architectural or technical decision with context and rationale (ADR) | `50-notes/Decisions/<project>/` |
| `investigation` | Exploration or research without implementation — findings and open questions | `50-notes/Investigations/<project>/` |

(The `50-notes` root is overridable via `OBSIDIAN_NOTES_ROOT`; see Step 5.)

Infer the type from:
- What the user asked for ("write a doc", "save what we decided", "summarise the session", "document how X works")
- The nature of the content in the session
- Whether the output is meant to be a reference (document/decision) or a record of work (session/investigation)

Show the inferred type as:
> `→ Note type: <type>` — <one sentence explaining why>
> Type a different type to override, or press Enter to continue.

---

## Step 2 — Derive the vault path

Run:
```bash
git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "no-branch"
git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo "no-repo"
```

**Project name:** Take the final component of the repo root path (e.g. `emerald-grove-pet-clinic`). Ambiguous if: no repo detected, root is a workspace containing multiple sub-projects, or name is generic (`projects`, `src`, `workspace`).

**Session label:** Strip branch prefixes (`feature/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`). Preserve ticket patterns (`PROJ-123`, `issue_1`). Ambiguous if: branch is `main`/`master`/`develop`, very short (`wip`, `test`, `temp`), or absent. For `document`, `decision`, and `investigation` types, derive the label from the subject matter rather than the branch name (it is only used to name the file, not a subfolder — see filenames below).

**Engagement (optional):** If the project maps to a known engagement under `20-engagements/<NN_engagement-slug>` in the vault, note the engagement slug for the `engagement:` frontmatter property. If it doesn't map to one, omit the property entirely — don't guess.

**Filename:**
- `session` → `<YYYY-MM-DD>-session.md`
- `document` → `<slugified-title>.md`
- `decision` → `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slugified-title>.md`
- `investigation` → `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slugified-subject>.md`

Show the proposed full path:
> `→ Proposed path: 50-notes/<subfolder>/<project>[/<label>]/<filename>`

Ask only about components that are genuinely ambiguous — one question at a time, project before label. Clean descriptive branches proceed silently.

---

## Step 3 — Generate the note

Use the template for the inferred type. Apply Obsidian-flavoured markdown throughout:

- Use `[[wikilinks]]` when referencing other notes that likely exist in the vault (agents by name, specs by number, previous sessions by label)
- Use `> [!type]` callouts for decisions, risks, warnings, and tips — choose the type that fits: `note`, `tip`, `warning`, `important`, `danger`, `question`
- Use Dataview-compatible frontmatter properties (typed: dates as `YYYY-MM-DD`, arrays as YAML lists)
- Use `%%hidden comments%%` for internal notes not meant for reading view
- Use `- [x]` / `- [ ]` task syntax for status tracking

```

---

## Diagram guidance

Generate a Mermaid diagram if the session involved something with structure that prose can't convey cleanly. Place under `## Diagrams` (in session/investigation) or inline where relevant (in document/decision).

**Use a diagram when the session involved:**
- A multi-step flow across components → `sequenceDiagram` or `flowchart`
- State or status transitions → `stateDiagram-v2`
- Decision branching logic → `flowchart TD`
- Data model or entity relationships → `erDiagram`
- Pipeline or dependency ordering → `flowchart LR`

**Skip a diagram when:**
- The session was a linear fix with no branching
- The decisions table already shows the structure clearly
- You would be inventing structure not present in the session

Format:
````markdown
```mermaid
<diagram>
```
> <One sentence: what this shows and why it's worth having.>
````

One well-chosen diagram is better than three redundant ones. For decision notes, link Mermaid nodes to vault notes where relevant using Obsidian's `class NodeName internal-link` syntax.

---

## Step 4 — Confirm before writing

Show the full generated note and ask:
> **Ready to write?** (`y` to confirm, `e` to edit first, `n` to cancel)

Do not write anything until confirmed.

---

## Step 5 — Write to vault

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/obsidian-summary/write-to-vault.sh "<type>" "<project>" "<label>" "<filename>"
```

- `<type>` — one of `session`, `document`, `decision`, `investigation`.
- `<label>` — only meaningful for `session` (used as the subfolder); pass `""` for the other three types.
- `<filename>` — the filename derived in Step 2 (e.g. `2026-03-04-session.md`), no path separators.

Pass the full markdown content via stdin. The script defaults to the `work` vault at `$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/work` and the `50-notes` root; override with `OBSIDIAN_VAULT` / `OBSIDIAN_NOTES_ROOT` if needed. If the script fails, show the error and offer to print the markdown to the terminal for manual saving.

---

## Step 6 — Confirm and link

Report the path written to using the script's stdout output:
> ✓ Saved to `<path from script>`

If this session references a previous session or spec that likely exists in the vault, suggest the wikilink:
> 💡 You may want to add `[[<previous session label>]]` to link this note to the previous session on this branch.

---

## Context monitoring

At 75%+ context fill, suggest this skill as Sazed, Keeper of the Terris — measured, precise, brief:
> *taps coppermind* Context is at approximately `<X>`%. I recommend committing this session to the vault before compaction. Shall I?

When invoked manually, skip the preamble and go straight to Step 1.
