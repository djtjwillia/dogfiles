# Note that if omzsh is being used, there are a great number of pre-defined git aliases available
# A list of them can be viewed by running the following:
#       alias | grep git
#
# Additional ones can be added here and will be loaded
alias gs='git status'
# change some of the zsh aliases to better fit my use
alias gpu='git push --set-upstream origin $(git_current_branch)'
alias glo='git log --oneline --graph --decorate'
alias gcm='git commit --message'
# in place of prior, longer aliases use these from zsh
# gsw - git switch
# gswc - git switch -c
# ga - git add
# gf - git fetch
# grb - git rebase
# gd - git diff
# gds - git diff staged
# gdb - git branch delete
